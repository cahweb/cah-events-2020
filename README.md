# Common - Events 2020

A mostly self-contained Wordpress plugin that displays CAH events.

## External Dependencies

1. All events are pulled from [https://events.ucf.edu/calendar/3611/cah-events/](https://events.ucf.edu/calendar/3611/cah-events/).
2. `events_html-vuejs.php` also calls the production version of Vue.js (2.6.11) via CDN. Specifically: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.11](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.11)

## Usage

Call the shortcode: `[events]` and add any of the following options.

If only given `[events]`, this plugin will assume `[events]` is:
```
[events filter="all" filter-format="" show-more-format="" hide-recurrence="false" num-events="5" front="false" show-all-when-none="false"]
```
Which will show only a list of 5 events with no filtering or show-more options.

There's no need to list an attribute if you wish to use the default option.

### Current available options:

The current shortcode configuration for CAH Upcoming Events located at https://www.cah.ucf.edu/newsroom/events/ is:
```
[events filter="all" filter-format="list" show-more-format="paged" hide-recurrence="true" num-events="5"]
```
The attributes `filter` and `num-events` are not necessary here since they are the default values.
